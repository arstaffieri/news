# The News

This is a website that gathers the top stories from the New York Times. It displays their titles, bylines, a breif summary of the article, and a link to the article on the New York Times' website.

#### Technologies
This project was built in React. With more time, I would add Cypress testing. The NYT API included photos with the article data. With more time, I would incorporate those photos into the design of the website. I would also like to make a layout that looks equally good on a desktop as on a mobile divice.
